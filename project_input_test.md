# Project Input Test

Created by heavily referencing the Django tutorial, the app named `project_input_test` in this Django environment is a testbed for writing and experimenting with web templates and database interactions in the **Setup Screen Epic**.

There is currently one model, named `Project`, dedicated to just simply storing a student project name and description.

The index page for `project_input_test` currently prints out a list of existing `Project`s in the database, with a name/description pair for each.

The admin page for Project models, based on [Part 7 of the Django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial07/), represents a barebones version of a customizable admin form.
